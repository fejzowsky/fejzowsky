Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul<br />
I was gone, but how was I to know?<br />
I didn't come this far to sink so low<br />
I'm finally holding on to letting go (x3)<br />
<br />
I'm just weathering a rough patch<br />
Another villain with an itch to scratch<br />
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole<br />
Why does the Hell make you feel so cold?<br />
Make a move and you pay for it<br />
Pick a Lord and you pray to it<br />
You're so demanding when you want the truth<br />
But your stories don't read for me<br />
<br />
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul<br />
I was gone, but how was I to know?<br />
I didn't come this far to sink so low<br />
I'm finally holding on to letting go<br />
<br />
Indecision Overload<br />
Keep a buckle on the Devil and your eyes on the road<br />
Reaching out for the hand of God<br />
But did you Think You'd Shake Your Own?<br />
This Killing Field is all grown over<br />
The Motherf*cker wants it wild<br />
Go sew your oats in alphabetical order<br />
The Anti-Antagonist is back in style<br />
Myopic, Cannot See Straight<br />
Dystopic, One Sin Too Late<br />
You gotta lie if you want to believe<br />
But your Bibles don't work on me<br />
<br />
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul<br />
I was gone, but how was I to know?<br />
I didn't come this far to sink so low<br />
I'm finally holding on to letting... GO<br />
<br />
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?<br />
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin<br />
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me<br />
I was more than you thought I could be<br />
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free<br />
<br />
You've Killed The Saint In Me<br />
How Dare You Martyr Me?<br />
You've Killed The Saint In Me<br />
<br />
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul<br />
